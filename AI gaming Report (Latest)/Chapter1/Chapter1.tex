\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Objectives}

This project aims to develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning \cite{li2017deep} (DRL) Tank game prototype using Unity3D \cite{isik2018unityrl} environment and editor. The main goal of the game is to have an autonomous agent tank that can destroy incoming enemy units while allowing friendly units into shelter. The agent tank is also known as the \textbf{turret}. In this game, the \textbf{shelter} is equivalent to the agent's position. 

\section{Scope of Work}
The following characteristics are implemented in this prototype game:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enemy or Friendly units die instantaneously, within a single shot.
    \item Bullets / Shells travel infinitely fast.
    \item Enemy / Friendly Units will disappear once it reaches the shelter.
    \item Agent Tank will be stationary, and placed in the center of the game.
    \item Enemy and Friendly units will spawn at random locations around the map.
The game ends when agent tank defeats 20 Enemy Tanks or allow 10 Friendly units into shelter. 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Organisation of Report}

This report is organised into 4 chapters. After this chapter, the next chapter will explain the mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics of the game. In Chapter 3, we will discuss about reinforcement learning and the process of tuning its parameters to achieve near optimal performance. Finally, in chapter 4 we conclude the report.
